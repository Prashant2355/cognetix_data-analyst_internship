# Sales data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a sales dataset to uncover business insights, revenue trends, and performance drivers using **Python** and data visualization techniques.

## Objective :-
- To understand overall sales performance
- To identify top-performing product lines and regions
- To analyze order status impact on revenue
- To discover seasonal and yearly sales trends
- To support data-driven business decision-making

## Dataset Overview :-
- **Dataset Name**: Sales Data Sample
- **Records**: Orders across multiple years
- **Key Columns**:
   - Product Line
   - Sales
   - Order Status
   - Country & State
   - Month & Year
   - Customer & Order Details

## Tools & Technologies Used :-
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation & aggregation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

## Analysis Performed
🔹 Product Performance
 - Sales by Product Line
 - Identification of top and low-performing products

🔹 Order Fulfillment Analysis
 - Sales distribution by Order Status
 - Revenue realization vs potential revenue

🔹 Geographic Analysis
- Sales by Country and State
- Identification of key revenue-contributing regions

🔹 Time-Based Analysis
- Monthly sales trends
- Year-wise revenue growth
- Seasonal pattern detection

## Visualizations Included
- **Bar charts** (Product line, Order status, Year-wise revenue)
- **Line charts** (Monthly sales trends)
- **Pie charts** (Country-wise and State-wise sales distribution)

These visualizations help translate raw data into clear business insights.

## Key Insights :-
- **Classic Cars** are the highest revenue-generating product line.
- The **USA** contributes the largest share of total sales.
- Sales peak during **October–November**, indicating strong seasonality.
- Most revenue comes from **Shipped** orders, highlighting efficient fulfillment.
- Some product lines and regions show potential for growth optimization.

## Conclusion :-
This project demonstrates how EDA and visualization can uncover meaningful insights from sales data and support strategic business decisions. The analysis can be extended further using dashboards or predictive modeling.
