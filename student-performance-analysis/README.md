# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student academic performance using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques. The goal is to understand how demographic and socio-economic factors influence students’ scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.

---

## Objective :-

- Analyze the distribution of student scores
- Identify performance differences based on **gender**, **parental education**, and **race/ethnicity**
- Extract actionable insights that can help educators and institutions improve learning outcomes

---

## Dataset Overview :-

- **Source:** Student Performance Dataset
- **Number of Records:** 1000 students
- **Key Features:**
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental Level of Education
  - Test Preparation Course
  - Math, Reading, and Writing Scores

---

## Tools & Technologies :-

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

---

## Analysis & Visualizations :-

The following key analyses were performed:

- Distribution of **Math Scores**
- Average scores by **Gender**
- Impact of **Parental Education** on student performance
- Performance comparison across **Race/Ethnicity groups**
- Effect of **Test Preparation Course** on scores

Professional charts such as **histograms, bar charts, box plots, and line plots** were used to clearly communicate insights.

---

## Key Insights :-

- Students with higher parental education levels generally perform better.
- Female students outperform males in reading and writing.
- Math scores show wider variability compared to other subjects.
- Race/Ethnicity Group E consistently achieves higher average scores.
- Test preparation courses have a positive impact on student performance.
