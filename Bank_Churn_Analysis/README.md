# Customer Churn Analysis 

This project presents an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a customer churn dataset to understand key demographic and behavioral factors that influence customer attrition. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns related to **age, tenure, gender, and geography**, which are critical for churn risk assessment.

---

##  Objective :-

- Analyze customer demographics and account characteristics
- Understand how **Age** and **Tenure** are distributed across customers
- Convert categorical variables into numerical format for analysis
- Extract insights that can support **customer retention strategies**
- Prepare the dataset for future churn prediction modeling

---

##  Dataset Overview :-

The dataset contains customer-level banking information, including:

- `Age`
- `Tenure`
- `Gender`
- `Geography`
- `Balance`
- `CreditScore`
- `NumOfProducts`
- `IsActiveMember`
- `EstimatedSalary`
- `Exited` (Target variable indicating churn)

Categorical variables such as **Gender** and **Geography** were encoded to enable numerical analysis.

##  Tools & Technologies Used :-

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data loading, cleaning, and transformation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

---

##  Analysis Performed :-

- Distribution analysis of **Age**
- Distribution analysis of **Tenure**
- Encoding of categorical features (**Gender, Geography**)
- Identification of customer segments based on age and tenure
- Exploratory analysis to understand potential churn-related patterns

---

##  Visualizations Included :-

- **Age Distribution** (count plot)
- **Tenure Distribution** (count plot)

These visualizations help identify customer concentration, early-stage churn risk, and long-term customer segments.

---

##  Key Insights :-

- Most customers fall within the **30–50 age group**, representing the core customer base.
- A significant portion of customers have **low tenure (0–3 years)**, indicating higher early-stage churn risk.
- Long-tenure customers (7+ years) are fewer but likely more loyal.
- Age and tenure emerge as important features for churn analysis and modeling.
- Retention efforts should focus strongly on customers in their initial years.
